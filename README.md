# Standalone Underwater Monitoring Station

Sensor-drivers and connection to ROS2 architecture [ROS2 Humble](https://docs.ros.org/en/ros2_documentation/humble/index.html).


This is a continuation of two previous projects for developing sensors to work underwater both as a Standalone Underwater Monitoring Station (SUMS) and for a mobile sensing rig mounted on a BlueRobotics BlueROV-2.

## Use

For a quick use, paste these commands
More details for each command come after

	git clone https://github.com/herkis/bachelor-2024

	python3 init.py
	. install/setup.bash
	ros2 launch launch/sensor.launch.py

Open a terminal window in the folder where you want to locate the program. 
Import all the files with the command (this will create a folder named SUMS/ with the program)

	git clone https://github.com/herkis/bachelor-2024

Build all the packages with init.py

	python3 init.py
	
Source the setup files

	. install/setup.bash
	
Launch the all nodes (sensor.launch.py contains parameters that can be changed by the user)

	ros2 launch launch/sensor.launch.py



To remove all of the files, go in the parent folder and paste this command

	sudo rm -r SUMS
	
## Documentation on code

A lot of the comments made in the files of "sensor_thermometer" folder can be applied to the 
code for the other sensors. Because of this the comments for the temperature code is more
detailed than for the other sensors.

## Battery code

There have been some issues regarding the hardware for battery sensing, hence the code not 
being finished. Though it may not be finished, a lot of the setup is fixed. 
What mainly needs to be done is fill in the code in "battery_data_publisher_node.py", as
well as making necessary adjustments in "init.py" and launch file. 

## Sensor suite

Sensors used in this project:

* Barometer: Blue Robotics BAR30
* Thermometer: Blue Robotics Celsius Fast-Response
* Dissolved Oxygen probe: Atlas Scientific
* Conductivity probe: Atlas Scientific
* Power Sense Module: BlueRobotics

## Barometer

Heavily based on the MS5837 library mentioned under [Libraries](#libraries).
Remember to enable I2C on the Raspberry Pi and connect on the correct pins!

## Thermometer

Heavily based on the TSYS01 library mentioned under [Libraries](#libraries).
Remember to enable I2C on the Raspberry Pi and connect on the correct pins!

## Disolve Oxygen

Based on a new library, called DOATLAS01, which was created with an heavily base on the TSYS01 library mentioned under [Libraries](#libraries).
Remember to enable I2C on the Raspberry Pi and connect on the correct pins!

## Conductivity

Based on a new library, called CATLAS01, which was created with an heavily base on the TSYS01 library mentioned under [Libraries](#libraries).
Remember to enable I2C on the Raspberry Pi and connect on the correct pins!
